Notes:
-After creating an API key, everyone gets the same image and JSON file content from NASA
-You can't simply put in the image url for the image source for the HTML
- There seems to be a certification error on my computer. 
Looking at piazza saw what this issue was, but it seemed to be addressed for macs yet I had a windows.
- urllib is something that doesn't have to be installed while urllib3 does have to be installed
- When trying out urllib3 there seemed to be errors when it came to installing it; it was installed already via the terminal yet was not registered in the code.
