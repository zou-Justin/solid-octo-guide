K36: Another DB Perspective
2022-05-03

Notes:
- When we view data in MongoDb we are viewing it in the form of JSON.
- JSON Format:
    - Start and end with {}
    - Separate key and value with colon
    - Spearate key:value pair with a comma
    - Keys are surrounded by quotes and are called fields in MongoDb
-Pros and cons of using JSON
    Pros:
    - JSON is easy to read 
    Cons:
    - Text based
    - Takes up lots of space
    - Limited in how much it can store
- MongoDb stores JSON in BSON format which is binary JSON which was optimized for speed and size. It is a combination of binary and JSON
- MongoDb stores BSON and viewed as JSON
- Export in BSON if you don't plan to view it after otherwise export in JSON

JSON CMD:
mongoimport
mongoexport

BSON CMD:
mongorestore
mongodump

We use a URI string to use each of these commands which is also known as a Uniform Resource Identifier
Example: mongodump --uri "mongodb+srv://<your username>:<your password>@<your cluster>.mongodb.net/sample_supplies"

Connect to MongoDb before using the commands shown here. Default database is admin which keeps track of existing users.
"show dbs"
The find command helps us do the same thing as the Atlas UI, it helps us find all objects with the specified field and value pair.
