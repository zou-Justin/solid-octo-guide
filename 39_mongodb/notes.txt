Aggregation Framework
- An Aggregation Framework is a way to query data in mongodb
- instead of .find we would use .aggregate
- this allows us to put things in an array and to more operations than simply filtering things
- $match is a filter and $project is a finer filter
- it lets us to do amazing things in mongodb
- $group can put it into multiple smaller group reserves
- Aggregation Framework has the sky as its limit anything is possible here.
- $sort increasing order cursor.sort()
- mongodb always makes it so you sort first then you use limit to get the most amount of documents as possible,
- indexes are useful and we can create them with createIndex()
- data modeling is the way to optimize your organization of fields and documents in the database
- Rule: Data is stored in the way it is used
- Upsert is a more complex way to update data
    - hybrid of update and insert
    - it will update if the document is matched and insert if it is not matched
    - use only when needed
