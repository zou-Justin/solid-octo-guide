Aggregation Framework
- An Aggregation Framework is a way to query data in mongodb
- instead of .find we would use .aggregate
- this allows us to put things in an array and to more operations than simply filtering things
- $match is a filter and $project is a finer filter
- it lets us to do amazing things in mongodb
- $group can put it into multiple smaller group reserves
