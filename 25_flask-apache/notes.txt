K25 -- Apache, Jump On It
1/19/2021

Notes
- Each IP address can only be used for one singular site
- The Config file helps determine what directories should be put on your IP address
    - In the example from the resources, it seems that you don't necessarily need to have the part pertaining to using the static directory
- 'service apache2 restart' and restarting apache is similar to saving the file 
    - If you change the python file, you have to save it again using this command
- You need to have the command 
"if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
You can't simply just have app.run() otherwise it won't work properly
- I assume in the config file when adding more directories you would use the alias and <Directory> tags
