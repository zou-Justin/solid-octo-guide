K37: Another DB Perspective
2022-05-09

Notes:
- You can insert new documents into MongoDB with both Atlas UI and terminal
    - Every document in MongoDb needs to have a unique underscore ID
        - Thye can be identical in every otherway as long as ids are different
    - You get errors otherwise
- findOne() function finds a random document in the 
- Insert() allows us to insert a new document into the collection list
- You can insert multiple documents by using an array
- Only the first document with the same id gets inserted and then a duplicate error will occur
- Ordered tag, if it is true, the database halts at the first duplicate, if it is false then every unique id gets inserted
- if you insert document into collection that doesn't exist, it will create it automatically
- if you insert a document without an id, it will be created automatically
- We can easily update the documents in our mongoDb database
    - updateOne() and updateMany()
        - updateOne is same as findOne which returns the first document that applies to the query
        - updateMany returns all that applies to the given query
        - It takes in two parameters, one is the filter and the other is what is being updated
            - $inc updates the field by that increment so its a plus not a equal
            - $set updates the field by setting it to that amount
    -deleteOne() and deleteMany()
        - deleteOne() is delete the first document wiht the given parameters
        - deleteMany() is delete all documents
        - We delete by the underscore id
