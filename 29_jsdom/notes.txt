JS for selecting HTML elements from the DOM:
document.getElementById(<ID>)
document.getElementsByTagName(<tag name>)

JS for user action awareness:
<Object in the DOM>.addEventListener(<Event>, <Function>)

in HTML:
<button id="b"> The button </button>

in JS:
var dasbut = document.getElementById("b")
dasbut.addEventListener('click', fxnname)

Other:
document.createElement(<HTML Tag Name>)
element.setAttribute(<Name>, <Value>)
element.getAttribute(<Name>)
element.remove()
element.innerHTML
element.appendChild(<Element>)
element.addEventListener(<Event>, <Function>) - same as above

We used my GCD function since it was less lines of code.
We realized it only worked the first time it was called but we fixed it by using var in front of each of the variables to instantiate them each time they were called.
