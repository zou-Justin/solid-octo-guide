DISCO(veries):
- Bootstrap containers contain content well and auto generate margins/padding nicely
- Unlike Foundation's XY grid system with cells, Bootstrap uses containers, rows, and cols
- Bootstrap has many useful form classes

QCC:
We note that we can link an external javaScript file that allows us to use elements that previously require javaScript.
The dropdown menu can go to different parts of the page by using ids.

Q0 
- Is there a way to align images in Bootstrap so that they are on the same line?
    - (Solved by placing images in divs, which we then arranged onto the same line)
- Asked the other duo about text-center as a class
Q1 
- We prefered Bootstrap over Foundation because it felt more organized and easy to understand. 
It had elements such container which felt a bit more intuitive than the x-y grid plane that is used for Foundation.
However overall the two frameworks feel very similar with similar classes so either one could work for us.
