K12: ...or The Only Constant is Change?
2021-10-7

Q0: If you remove render_template, when the function is called in test_tmplt()
it will not work.

Q1: No, but our best guess would be https://localhost:5000/templates/model_tmplt.html

Q2: The arguments are taken to decide which html file is being loaded and what is being dislayed.
In the example model_tmplt.html, the input foo becomes the title and the input
and the input collection has each of its contents displayed on its own line.

Questions:
Debated between /my_foist_template and /templates/model_tmplt

Predictions:
Initial link will display "No hablo queso!"
If accessing https://localhost:5000/templates/model_tmplt.html
then it will display fooooo as the title and then

Discoveries:
@app.route gives the route to the url after https://localhost:5000.
So, https://localhost:5000/my_foist_template is the correct url and our prediction was wrong.
<title> tag sets the name of the tab(DIFFERENT FROM HEADING)
