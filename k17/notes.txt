K17: Notes About Other Trios' Code for K16
2021-10-26
Time spent: 15 minutes

NOTES:

Some trios used c.fetchall() as a way to access all of the data in the database. 
They used this in a print statement to check the content of their tables.

A lot of trios used INSERT INTO <table> VALUES(?, ?, ?) along with c.execute(command, <value1>, <value2>, <value3>)
to insert certain values in each column more efficiently. It also improved readability in the code. 

Some trios made functions for the overall process oof reading a file and making a table. They then called the functions
for each csv file. 

Many trios cleared the table each time if it existed. There were also trios who used IF NOT EXISTS to check if the table
existed before creating it. 

We learned that backslashes can divide up long chunks of code into several lines.
