Notes:
- The dollar sign is used for multiple operators in mongodb
Query Operators
    - $eq
    - $gt
    - $gte
    - $ne
    - $lt
    - $lte
    - { <field>: { <operator>: <value> }}
Logic Operators
    - $and 
    - $or
    - $nor - fail for both
    - $not
    - it goes { <field>: { <operator>: [{statement1},{statement2},... ]}}
You can combine operators together with $and and $gt and $lt

$expr allows us to use variables, conditionals and aggregation expression
    -you can compare lets say start station id with end station id which is very useful
You use $ next to a field to signify you are looking at the value of that field
Array operators
    - $all - all given fields
    - $size - all arrays with that size
    -$push
        - add an element into an array
        - turns field into an array field
We can use projection to only look at the fields that we were looking at
    - 1 includes the field
    - 0 excludes the field
    - db.collection.find({query}, {projection})
    - $elemMatch matches wit an array field that matches this output
MongoDB uses dotnotation in order to find nested documents or position of array
