K35: Another DB Perspective
2022-05-03


Notes:
- MongoDb is a NoSql Document database which means that they store data in containers similar to JSON objects
- Document stores data in Field Value pairs
    - Field is a unique identifier for a datapoint
    - Value is data related the given Field.
- Atlas is the cloud Database with MongoDb at the core of Atlas.
- Atlas will help us deploy our database in the cloud
- Atlas deploys clusters(groups of services that store data)
- Instance: a single machine locally or in the cloud which is MongoDb in this case.
- We have replica sets which are instances that store the data so if one instance goes down the other ones still work properly
