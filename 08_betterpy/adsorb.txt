TASK ALPHA!
Questions: How to change Justin's code into a function? Simpler way to read through Yaying's file (without looping through each character in a string)? If random int doesn't fall into a range, what happens? Based on other peers' codes, is the best way to solve this problem to find another random int and try again?
Comments: Nice use of floats and intervals, Justin. Interesting to see Yaying's code use randomchoices instead of other random methods. Yoonah's code similar to Justin's, really smart to multiply everything by 10 to avoid using decimals. Josh method of adding percentages repeatedly seems efficient! Overall, most people seem to use this "intervals" idea and random number methods. Most people also started out with similar ways to read the file and converting the contents to a dictionary.
Concerns: Justin's code should have been a function?
