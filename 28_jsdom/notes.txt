 K28 -- Manipulating the DOM
 2022-02-08t

 Notes: 
 - Objects are declared in JavaScript with a bunch of dictionaries
    - You can call the items you created in each object
    - You can create functions inside the dictionaries and even call items
        - I believe this is possible since you can set variables as functions in JavaScript
- You can set variables as functions or declare functions normally
    - ex: function f(x) vs var f = function(x)
- With document.getElementsByTagName you get all elements as an array that have the tag name you inputted
- var keyword allows for automatic typecast
