Foundation Notes:
- There are 3 ways to use Foundation:
  - We can install it with a package manager that already has the compiled CSS and JavaScript as well as the source files.
  - We can also install it with something called Foundation CLI, and then creating a new project with foundation keyword
  - We can also simply link the online CDN Links and get the online CSS for it
    - This is also the preferred method
- Foundation prioritizes mobile users
  - you code for small screens first and larger screens automatically inherit these aspects and you can customize them if needed
