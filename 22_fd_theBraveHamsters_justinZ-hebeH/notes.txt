K22: Who Does Frame Work For?

Foundation Notes:
- There are 3 ways to use Foundation:
  - We can install it with a package manager that already has the compiled CSS and JavaScript as well as the source files.
  - We can also install it with something called Foundation CLI, and then creating a new project with foundation keyword
  - We can also simply link the online CDN Links and get the online CSS for it
    - This is also the preferred method
- Foundation prioritizes mobile users
  - You code for small screens first and larger screens automatically inherit these aspects and you can customize them if needed
- Foundation has powerful layout assets
  - Its new powerful grid system is the XY-grid that combines old legacy systems in a much cleaner ways
  - It also has a powerful form layout
  - This is very useful for dynamic resizing
  - Defining the class of a div to be "grid-x" or "grid-y" will make the div render vertically/horizontally
    - These divs can then be filled with divs of class "cell"
- Like other frontend framework, it uses ids and classes in order to call the CSS
- Compared to previous iterations, Foundation is much faster (50%) and more condensed.
- Foundation has built-in mixins
  - Ex:@include xy-cell-size($size, $gutters, $gutter-type, $breakpoint, $vertical);
  - Mixins are a SASS feature that allow you to define reusable styles
    - SASS 
        - Stands for "Syntactically Awesome Style Sheet" (actually)
        - Is a more advanced version of CSS that includes variables, inheritance, and more
        - File extension of .scss
        - Foundation was written with SASS. The _settings.scss file includes variables 
        such as $button-font-color and $grid-container-padding that can be changed
